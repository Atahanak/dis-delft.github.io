                        <strong>Summary:</strong>
                        we are searching for a motivated research software engineer to lead the development of
                        dataset discovery, data augmentation, and data integration tools using ML techniques. You will
                        be working alongside a team of excellent PhD & MSc students. You will build (or use your
                        existing) experience in working with modern (Big) data and cluster management tools (e.g.,
                        Apache Flink, Spark, Valentine, Kubernetes).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This position is a unique and exciting challenge to help create a new ground-breaking
                        technology. Your main goal will be to design and implement open-source software that handles
                        large-scale data and improve Machine Learning pipelines.

                        <li>
                            You are an expert in software development (Python, Java, etc.), and you have a good habit of
                            maintaining the documentation of your code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will be working in a team with doctoral students and researchers. Together you will
                            explore the cutting-edge technologies in Data Management and Machine Learning/Deep Learning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are fluent in English and can communicate clearly and effectively.

                        We are searching for two self-motivated PhD students and one postdoctoral researcher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are building a novel programming and execution model for data-intensive cloud applications,
                        guaranteeing consistency and scalability with minimal effort from programmers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Towards this goal, we perform research on an intermediate representation (IR) for cloud
                        applications, capable of capturing programmersâ€™ intent while being amenable to parallelization
                        and distribution. Under the hood lies Stateflow: a parallel, transactional FaaS system based on
                        streaming dataflows, able to execute general cloud applications. We are now extending Stateflow with
                        the ability to adapt at runtime and sustain low-latency at a high scale.
                    </p>

                        Apply if you like to work in the broad areas of distributed systems, Cloud computing,
                        programming languages/compilers, and database systems.
