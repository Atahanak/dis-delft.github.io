## About

Bart is a PhD student at the Data-Intensive Systems group under the guidance of Dr. Jeremie Decouchant and Dr. Lydia Y. Chen.
His research aims to scale computational workloads across multiple devices by moving the computation to the data source instead of moving data. This allows for the collaboration between different devices without sharing (privacy sensitive) data.


Current interests include:

- Federated Learning in heterogeneous systems
- (Distributed) Continual Learning
- Byzantine Learning
- Optimization of DNN inference on Edge devices
