## About
I am a PhD Candidate in the [Web Information Systems (WIS)](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/). There, I am supervised by Dr. [Jie Yang](https://yangjiera.github.io/) and Prof.Dr.Ir. [Geert-Jan Houben](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7SLMWEcAAAAJ&hl=en).
I am part of the Kappa team (within WIS) and the TU Delft AI Lab [Design@Scale](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab).
Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) where I contributed to two EU H2020 projects, [TRIGGER](https://trigger-project.eu/) and [PERISCOPE](https://periscopeproject.eu/).
I received my MSc and BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) in 2019 and 2017 respectively.

I work on human-centred approaches to Explainable AI, with a particular focus on Language Models. By drawing connections between Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Design, I aim to create computational methods and tools that support explainability end-users and are grounded in the understanding their uses and purposes for explainable AI systems.
