## About

Marcel Gregoriadis received his B.Sc. in Stuttgart (Germany), and completed his M.Sc. at HU Berlin, both in Computer Science.
Before and during that time, he has interned and worked for several software companies, auxiliary to his work as a freelance web developer.

During his studies, he has also co-led [BeFoo](https://www.instagram.com/befoo.paris), a startup that offered individualized and subscription-based meal deliveries in Paris, as a technical director, as well as co-founded [Abracadalo](https://abracadalo.com), a premium API-service for Low-Code app developers.

In 2023, he started his Ph.D. at TU Delft's DIS group, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Johan Pouwelse. His research focuses on the intersection of decentralized systems, machine learning, and information retrieval.
During his research in Berlin, however, he has also been exposed to blockchain technology and data deduplication.

In his free time, he enjoys reading non-fiction, hitting the gym, and coding on side-projects.
