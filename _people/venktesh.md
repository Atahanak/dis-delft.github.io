Prior to joining the WIS group, Venktesh was a PhD candidate at IIIT-Delhi  and a Prime Minister fellow working at the intersection of IR and NLP for content curation and enrichment in online learning platforms.
Venkteshâ€™s goal is to **create interpretable robust complex question answering systems that can reason over heterogeneous sources for satisfying user information needs**. I am also interested in explainable fact checking of complex claims through multi-step reasoning.
