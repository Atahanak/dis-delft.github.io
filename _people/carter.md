## About

I am an intellectually curious "scientist-ethicist" interested in ensuring scientific progress always serves us and our communities. My research interests include AI ethics, data privacy, and bioethics. For my interdisciplinary PhD at the University of Galway, I researched how to promote more meaningful, value-driven privacy choices on our smartphones. I also hold a master's degree in biomedical science (Utrecht University) and a bachelor's degree in biochemistry (major) and music (minor) (Mount Holyoke College). In my current position as a postdoctoral researcher at TU Delft, I hope to continue utilizing my interdisciplinary communication skills to continue building bridges between disciplines and between experts and the public.

Having grown up in the North Woods of Minnesota, I am passionate about nature and enjoy birding, hiking, and taking long walks. I also am a hobbyist upright and electric bass player, playing jazz, blues, rock, and classical music.
