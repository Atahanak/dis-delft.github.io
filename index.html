            The Data-Intensive Systems (DIS) group is one of the sections of the
            Department of Software Technology (ST) of the Faculty Electrical
            Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (EEMCS) of Delft University
            of Technology. Until 2023, the DIS group was called the Distributed
            Systems (DS) group.

        <p>
            The <strong>mission</strong> of the DiS group is to model, design,
            implement, and analyze distributed systems and algorithms. Its
            <strong>research</strong> is fundamental, aimed at the development and
            evaluation of new generic concepts in systems software, and
            application-driven, motivated by important application areas, such as
            e-science, big data processing, blockchains, large-scale machine learning,
            and online social networks. Much of it is experimental, validating the
            proposed new concepts by means of implementation and deployment in
            prototypes that are used in the real world. The
            <strong>two research areas</strong> of the DIS group are
            <strong>distributed machine-learning systems</strong> and
            <strong>cooperative systems</strong> (with a strong focus on
            <strong>blockchain technology</strong>). The Section Data-Intensive
            Systems leads the
            <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/delft-blockchain-lab" target="_blank"
            >Delft Blockchain Lab</a
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>teaching</strong> of the DIS group consists of BSc courses on
            networks and operating systems, and of MSc courses on Blockchain
            Engineering, Cloud Computing, Distributed Algorithms, Distributed Systems
            and Performance Analysis of Computer Systems.
