                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> As machine learning (ML) continues to gain prominence in today's world, 
                            it is becoming increasingly clear that databases and ML systems are two faces of the same coin. 
                            Drawing on my experience in both product and research teams, I will provide three different perspectives 
                            of why I think that databases and machine learning systems are deeply connected. The talk will be 
                            structured around three main topics: execution, optimizations, and abstractions. The audience will 
                            discover how classical machine learning runtimes are closely related to query processing, 
                            and how ML and database operations can be co-optimized. Finally, I will showcase how to turn relational 
                            algebra into the tensor operations. Overall, this talk will demonstrate that databases 
                            and machine learning systems are fundamentally intertwined, and that recognizing this connection 
                            can foster exciting advancements in both fields.</p>

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> The past years have been marked by several breakthrough results in the domain of generative AI, 
                            culminating in the rise of tools like ChatGPT, able to solve a variety of language-related tasks without specialized training. 
                            In this talk, I outline novel opportunities in the context of data management, enabled by these advances. 
                            I discuss several recent research projects, aimed at exploiting advanced language processing for tasks such as 
                            parsing a database manual to support automated tuning, or mining data for patterns, described in natural language. Finally, 
                            I discuss our recent and ongoing research, aimed at synthesizing code for SQL processing in general-purpose programming languages,

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> The rapid progress of machine learning in the last decade has been fueled by the increasing scale of data and compute. 
                            However, this ever-increasing scale has created significant challenges for machine learning, which center around two fundamental bottlenecks: 
                            data movement (communications) and data quality. To alleviate these bottlenecks, one must jointly optimize and analyze data and learning. 
                            In this talk, I will share some of our research in this direction, focusing on optimizing data movements to enable large-scale, distributed and decentralized learning.

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> Modern database systems have been progressively expanding their use cases far outside traditional bookkeeping 
                            and data analytics, and into artificial intelligence workloads like machine learning and mathematical optimization. This in turn motivates 
                            the need for native in-database automatic differentiation to better support these use cases.

                            In this talk, we present RelationalAD (RAD), our framework for automatic differentiation at RelationalAI (RAI). 
                            Rel, the modeling language underlying RelationalAI, is declarative and can be viewed as a generalization of Datalog 
                            with infinite relations (e.g. arithmetic), aggregation, and relational abstraction. The input to RAD is a Rel program 
                            that defines a (set of) relational views and the output is another Rel program that defines new views that are the derivatives 
                            with respect to some given input relations. We show that performing AutoDiff inside a high-level database language like Rel 
                            allows us to evaluate derivatives while enjoying many features offered by the underlying database engine like factorization, 
                            query optimization and compilation, as well as support for higher-order derivatives. We present several examples covering 
                            recursive Rel programs, matrix calculus, neural network training, and gradient descent among others. We conclude with some challenges, 
                            design issues, as well as open problems.</p>

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> The rapid growth of data volume poses challenges for modern database systems 
                            in terms of space and time. Compressed data direct computing, as a solution that combines the advantages 
                            of space savings from data compression and efficiency gains from direct computing, has been proved to be 
                            a promising research in the database field. We find that the core of compressed data direct computing is 
                            data reuse, and it can be extended to ML workloads that are also concerned with data size and 
                            computational complexity. In this talk, we introduce Deep Reuse, a concrete implementation of data reuse 
                            into ML workloads. It shows great potential for inference latency reduction on popular neural networks 
                            such as CNNs. Inspired by Deep Reuse, we further carry out research in three aspects: 1) applying it to 
                            optimized operators such as the fast convolution algorithm Winograd, 2) embedding it into neural networks 
                            to address non-determinism and low accuracy problems through a consistent training process, and 
                            3) extending the application to resource-constrained IoT devices.</p>
